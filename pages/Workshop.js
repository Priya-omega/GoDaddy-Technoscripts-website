                </div>

                <p> We conduct workshops on Embedded, ARM 7, ARM 9, Raspberry pi, Arduino & robotics for students of engineering, Diploma & science. </p>
                <p> This workshop will be based on synchronization of latest technologies used in industry . The idea behind the workshop is to develop an interest among the upcoming engineers by giving them knowledge of various types of new systems with their basic building along with their integration with upcoming top notch communication technologies. It also introduces them to the needs of the current industrial sector. In this workshop the participants will be told about all the latest technologies that are coming up in the Automation industry. Apart from all these the team will share the experiences of various projects which they had done in past and some of their current projects. </p>
                <p> The workshop addresses various concepts related to engineering principles and real life applications and the integration of different components. Students will be engaged in designing and building a robot using our educational kit, starting from simple and leading to complex robotics. Ultimately, these workshop will challenge the way students view Robotics Technology and what they can do with it. </p>
                <p> This workshop will also provide a platform where young engineers can mold their imagination into reality and feel the excitement first hand. With this end in view, we extend our support and technical expertise to the young Engineers of your College in the form of this workshop. </p>
                <p> We will be providing the students knowledge by giving them exposure to  of various new systems and introducing them to the needs of the current industrial  & automation sector. Training will be provided by core professionals in their fields. It will help student in the development of their academic major project. </p>

                    <p>TechnoScripts aims to give India&apos;s most reputed workshop in the field of Embedded System.
                        We are aiming to train participants and produce skilled technocrat and equips them with all
                        the tools, techniques and methods needed for the industry. Our mentors had trained about
                        6000 students and impacted around 20000 students through our various outreach initiatives.
                        These workshops are intended to produce technocrats for the next generation. The live
                        interactive sessions and real life examples will take participants inside the minds of
                        technocrats.
